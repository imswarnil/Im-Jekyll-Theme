  bio: >
   I'm not just a guy with a camera and a keyboard — I'm a man on a mission. From engineering dashboards to editing timelines, 
   I breathe narrative into numbers and soul into scripts. With 3 years in the Salesforce ecosystem, deep dives into data, 
    and a passion for storytelling, I create both products and perspectives. This site is my playground — part resume, part 
    portfolio, part personal logbook. Expect code, chaos, camera gear breakdowns, and stories straight from Bangalore's caffeinated streets.
