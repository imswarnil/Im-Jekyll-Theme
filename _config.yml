  # Summary / Bio
  bio: >
    I'm not just a guy with a camera and a keyboard â€” I'm a man on a mission. From engineering dashboards to editing timelines, 
    I breathe narrative into numbers and soul into scripts. With 3 years in the Salesforce ecosystem, deep dives into data, 
    and a passion for storytelling, I create both products and perspectives. This site is my playground â€” part resume, part 
    portfolio, part personal logbook. Expect code, chaos, camera gear breakdowns, and stories straight from Bangalore's caffeinated streets.

  # Fun Stuff
  fun_facts:
    - "I once edited a video for 14 hours straight. No caffeine. Just vibes."
    - "I treat Notion like it's a second brain. And maybe it is."
    - "My aesthetic is somewhere between minimal monk and maximal meme lord."
    - "I believe even error messages can have personality."
    - "Half my YouTube videos start with: â€˜So, hereâ€™s what happenedâ€¦â€™"
