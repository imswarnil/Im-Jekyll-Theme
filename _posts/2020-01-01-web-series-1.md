## About "Chronicles of the Cosmic Drifters"

Welcome, space cadets, to the most unpredictable journey in the galaxy! "Chronicles of the Cosmic Drifters" follows Captain Rex Nebula, his overly enthusiastic robot sidekick Bolt, the perpetually unimpressed alien pilot Xylar, and Dr. Quibble, a scientist whose experiments usually end in minor explosions. 

Each episode brings new challenges, from outsmarting bureaucratic space slugs to accidentally starting intergalactic food fights. Tune in for laughs, lasers, and a lot of heart.

### Production Notes
This series was filmed entirely in a repurposed janitor's closet with state-of-the-art cardboard sets and a generous helping of imagination.
